This project was created to start using Cypress as a tool to check how it works, how easy is to handle UI tests with Typescript and Cypress, and the differences between Cypress and other tools that I already knew such as Selenium, or Playwright.

The project has the minimum to configure Cypress to be working on CI, and launch three tests over the functionality of the page https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/ creater for this matter.

Specifically, it tests, headless mode, 3 tests described in the webpage:
https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/add_remove_elements/
https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/checkboxes
https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login

The code was written using the AI helper in the IDE, which was also the first time I used it. It is amazing how fast a GUI test can be done nowadays, doing minor adjustment to the AI suggestions in the structure or the testing criteria.

The test structure used is a mix of Page Object Model and Actions Oriented Test, just as most QA devs around the community recommend for Cypress.

In the future I will expand my knowledge on Cypress, and if I see something interesting I might also expand the project with it. The future is very promising for testing tools!
